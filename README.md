![Angular animate on model change demo](https://ngmilk.rocks/content/images/2015/12/angular-model-change-animation.gif)


### [See a demo](http://ng-milk.github.io/angular-animate-model-change/)
A directive that will help you animate elements when the model updates with some nifty CSS, ng-animate not needed. Read more about it [here](https://ngmilk.rocks/2015/12/08/animate-elements-when-a-model-changes-in-angularjs/).


## Usage
1. Include `ng-animate-model-change.js`.
2. **Optional**: Include `ng-animate-model-change.css` (just if you don't plan to add any CSS of your own).
3. Add `dm.animateModelChange` as a dependency to your app.
4. Profit!

## Bower
Installable via `bower`:

```bash
bower install ng-animate-model-change
```

## Example

```html
[...]
<section animate-model-change class="number" model="{{model}}"></section>
[...]
```

...and some nice styling:

```css
.number{
  transition:
    0.3s color ease,
    0.3s transform ease;
}

.number--increment{
  color: green;
  transform: scale(1.6);
}

.number--decrement{
  color: red;
  transform: scale(0.8);
}
```

You can see more examples in [index.html](https://github.com/ng-milk/angular-animate-model-change/blob/master/index.html).


## Configuration
You can configure the the timeout duration & increment, decrement and non-number classes (for those situations when the model update is not a number).

```html
<span class="foo"
      animate-model-change
      model="{{sampleNumber3}}"
      increment-class="up"
      decrement-class="down"
      non-number-class="unknown"
      timeout="1000">
  ...
</span>
```
